# GraphQL

A project to experiment with the basics of GraphQL using Prisma and Apollo.

Building a message/comment database.

One of the benefits of GraphQL is that queries return exactly what you need - no more over or under fetching.

GraphQL is strongly typed. Once the schema is set, the teams on the frontend and backend know exactly what they'll be working with.
